[the poet met the second peacock and 

a cat that was once in his dream.

the two creatures ride, 

side by side,

visible under the same shade of light.

it's either,

one or the other

an oscillator perhaps

better be a harmonic one,

if not simple - 


the boy and the girl,

the churches and the cathedrals

the stones and the steels

the faeces and the laces

the mermaids and the goblins


he saw the light,

leaking from between the two

is it either or

or both and 


the peacock spreaded its tail and its color and texture too secure

like an old tale starting with the phrase "once upon a time"

a cup that never spills

a moon that never eats


more importantly, 

it moved its beak and the only sound coming out is that of a peacock

maybe he is expecting a duck after all



and what happened to the cat 

the cat

the cat and the poet looked into each others' eyes and waited

until it finished its latest dream,

in which he did not appear 

and in silence it walked away


and so concluded neither nor

the light was after all not the light

only a rebelious one that did not follow the law of snells
